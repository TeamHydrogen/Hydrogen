# What is Hydrogen?

Hydrogen is a framework for your Roblox projects and games, which handles 
tasks which are boring and stuff every project might need.

You might write these yourself, or end up using sub-par solutions that are
not ideal for large games that need to be expanded.

We have modules for player data, module loading, advanced logging, and more!

## Why Hydrogen?

This project's creator, [Sophie](https://github.isophes.com), had
found that they were often taking code along with them on projects for
basic tasks, and some are still writing their own code for stuff they 
don't need to be writing.

So Sophie decided to put modules together, in a framework, for others to use 
and focus on making their games.

Other frameworks are great, but focus on the wrong things. They're too 
technical and don't provide what developers actually need to make their games.
