# Contributing

To contribute to the project, there are multiple ways. None of these are monetised yet, however 
we may add some funding options in the future.

## Current Options

- We would love new features to be suggested! Please go to [our discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/385151591524597761/1370149181137752116) and suggest
features to be added!

- We would also appreciate more contributors. Currently, Team Hydrogen is a one-man (well, woman) band of Sophie! 
Just launch a PR and we'll work with you to get it merged!

- Just use the framework! Hydrogen needs to be tested greatly, and to know what works and what 
doesn't earlier helps us iterate faster and figure out the best way to handle things!

> [!CAUTION] A quick thought... 
> We **MIGHT** add Opt-in telemetry data in the future, this will be open source and 
> publically accessible data, which will help us know the scale of Hydrogen, how many games use it, and how many users it serves.
> 
> This will help us get a grasp of knowing whether our tool actually works, be able to improve it and also provide similar robust tools in the future!
>
> If we add this, it will be added to this section as a form of contributing to enable telemetry.
