# Contributing

To contribute to the project, there are multiple ways. None of these are monetised yet, however 
we may add some funding options in the future.

## Current Options

- We would love new features to be suggested! Please go to [our discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/385151591524597761/1370149181137752116) and suggest
features to be added!

- We would also appreciate more contributors. Currently, Team Hydrogen is a one-man (well, woman) band of Sophie! 
Just launch a PR and we'll work with you to get it merged!

- Just use the framework! Hydrogen needs to be tested greatly, and to know what works and what 
doesn't earlier helps us iterate faster and figure out the best way to handle things!
